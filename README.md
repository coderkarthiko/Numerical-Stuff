## Numerical Stuff

C++ implementations of various numerical algorithms (mostly from Linear Algebra). 

## determinant.cpp
Finding determinant of an N * N matrix in O(N^3) using Gaussian elimination. Determinant is trace of the matrix in row echelon form.

## inverse.cpp
Finding inverse of an N * N using Gauss-Jordan elimination.

## linear_solver.cpp
Solves Ax = y by computing (A^-1)(yT). Basic stuff.
