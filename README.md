# Numerical-Stuff

C++ implementations of various numerical algorithms (mostly from Linear Algebra).

## determinant.cpp
Finding determinant of an N * N matrix in O(N^3) using Gaussian elimination. Determinant is trace of the matrix in row echelon form.

## inverse.cpp
Finding inverse of an N * N using Gauss-Jordan elimination. Standard stuff.

## mysimplex.cpp
Implementation of a version of the simplex algorithm I came up with (slower than the original one).
